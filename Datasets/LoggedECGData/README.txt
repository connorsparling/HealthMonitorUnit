**Note: for all tests I left the black lead on the low left side just above pelvis

Lead placements for Test 2 and 4 produced the best shaped waveforms.

Test1 - Red Lead - Right side - upper chest
	Blue Lead - Left side - upper chest

Test2 - Red Lead - Right side - lower chest, closer to the center of chest
	Blue Lead - Left side - lower chest, center left

Test3 - Red Lead - Right side - lower chest, closer to the center of chest
	Blue Lead - Left side - Upper chest, center left

Test4 - Red Lead -  Right side - lower test, closer to the center of chest
	Blue Lead - Left side - lower test, outer left

Test5 - Bad data

Test6 - Back and forth between good and bad waveforms
